# HeartApp

Good afternoon, you are on the page of the open application for Iphone HeartApp. The application allows you to track various health indicators, such as: pulse, pressure and oxygen, as well as adjust sleep and the number of steps needed to improve health indicators.
The application will be developed in several stages
1) Creation of a common UI, Architecture and connection of a mechanism for calculating the pulse through the camera flash (in progress)
The remaining stages will appear during further development.
At the moment, most of the UI and animations have already been implemented in the application, the heart rate calculation algorithm has been integrated with its further display on the screen
